--Overview--
The Rat in a Maze Visualizer is a web-based tool designed to visually demonstrate the "Rat in a Maze" dynamic programming problem. 
This application allows users to explore how a rat navigates through a grid (representing a maze) from a starting point to a destination while avoiding obstacles.
The visualizer illustrates the rat’s journey step-by-step, solving the problem through dynamic programming, showing backtracking and pathfinding techniques in real-time.


--Technologies Used--
React.js: The core framework for building the interactive front-end interface.
CSS/SCSS: For creating visually appealing grids and smooth animations.
Dynamic Programming Algorithm: The core of the logic used to determine the rat’s optimal path.


--Future Enhancements--
Add support for different maze-solving algorithms like BFS, DFS, or A*.
Include an option for random maze generation.
Implement varying difficulty levels with preset maze configurations.
